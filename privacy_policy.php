        <p>  
       If you use a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, it is encrypted via the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). 
       Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. 
       After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted. 
       All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a collaboration of brands like Visa,
      MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
